    # - The standard DB engine port is used by default
    #   (MySQL: 3306, PostgreSQL: 5432, MongoDB: 27017)
    # - Specify as "host:port" if differs

    pool-settings:
      # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
      # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
      #   connections to the database backend.
      # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
      #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
      maximum-pool-size: 10

      # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
      # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
      #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
      #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
      minimum-idle: 10

      # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
      # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
      #   connection time limit.
      maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes

      # This setting controls how frequently the pool will 'ping' a connection in order to prevent it
      # from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure, measured in milliseconds.
      # - The value should be less than maximum-lifetime and greater than 30000 (30 seconds).
      # - Setting the value to zero will disable the keepalive functionality.
      keepalive-time: 0

      # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
      # connection from the pool, before timing out.
      connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds

      # This setting allows you to define extra properties for connections.

      # these if you are using PostgreSQL)
